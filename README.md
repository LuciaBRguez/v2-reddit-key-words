### v2-reddit-key-words

##### Objective:
Find potential signs of depression in the author through a text search engine.

##### Functionality:
This script searches for keywords in an English text.
This script is applied to a representative number of posts on the r / depression subreddit and outputs a list of terms that appear significantly more in that forum than in general English texts.
The "empty words" are removed.

##### Conclusion (Comparing v1 and v2):
In our particular context "depression", "empty words" are essential, so v1 of this project is more convenient. For another context, however, it could be very useful.
